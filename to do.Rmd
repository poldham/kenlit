### Clean Up Tasks

1. Remove person names including the literal name Kenya and purge paperids. In future with the Lens adjust the search if possible to avoid the author names field.

Check that the removal of names including Kenya does not exclude government publications or institutional authors.

2. Clean affiliation names lacking a grid id or affiliation id. Parse the entries to extract town and country names and geocode. 

3. Address variance in count of results from the Lens in future updates.

### Possible Future Development

1. Text mine the title, abstract, keywords and fos fields for place names in Kenya using geonames. Then generate maps with coordinates linked to the data.
